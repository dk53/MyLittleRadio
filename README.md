# My Little Radio

This project is built with **SwiftUI** and **The Composable Architecture (TCA)**. It's a basic radio app that lists radio stations, allowing users to view details and play station streams. Since TCA was a new framework for me, I worked on balancing SwiftUI principles with TCA requirements, trying to keep things as simple and manageable as I could.

## Project Overview

- **Data Fetching**: Data is retrieved from a mock Node.js server that simulates an API calls, providing station information from `http://localhost/stations`.


### Features

- **Navigation to Detail View**: Selecting a station opens a detail view with the full station name and playback controls.
- **Audio Playback**: Audio streaming functionality was built using an AVPlayer trying to fit into a TCA Feature which manage play/pause actions and state updates.
- **UI**: I experimented with SwiftUI's design capabilities, focusing on layout, colors, and basic animations. This is my first real experience with SwiftUI, so I didn't push things too hard.

## What I Did

1. **Fully Modularized**: Each feature is fully modularized, with concerns split, ensuring scalability and making shared components like the `AudioPlayer` or `Networking` modules easily reusables across the app.

2. **Fully Tested**: All app features are fully tested, and views are covered by screenshot tests to ensure consistent UI across updates.

3. **Integration with Mock Server**: Replaced the mock data with live data from a local server. Added a simulated loader and an error-handling popup with a retry option.
   
4. **Navigation with Detail View**: Integrated navigation to a `StationDetailsView` for each station. Initially tried a hero animation but encountered display artifacts, so I reverted to using a sheet.

5. **Audio Streaming**: Using `AudioPlayerFeature`, users can play and pause streams directly from the detail view. This TCA feature handles state updates in line with play/pause controls.

6. **Mini Player**: Integrated a mini player to a `StationView`. It is showing the current playing station with a play pause button.

7. **Animations**: I leverage SwiftUI animation capabilities to animate the play/pause button and the playing spectrum side to the playing station.

8. **Accessibility**: Added a little accessibility label on radio station cards to support VoiceOver for people which needs it.

## Challenges

### Managing TCA State and Dependencies

With multiple features needing to interact and share state, managing dependencies like `audioPlayerClient` was occasionally challenging, especially when working with mock data in tests. Having `AppFeature` manage multiple feature states was useful but can become overwhelming if the app grows and will need modularisation

### SwiftUI Animations

Being new to SwiftUI, I experimented with various animations, including the `matchedGeometryEffect` for a hero-style animation, but eventually opted for a more straightforward sheet presentation due to artifact issues.

### Testing with XCTest

Switching to XCTest rather than swift testing for speed, and few ressources where available online.
Also Leveragng TCA `TestStore` to test features.

## What I Learned

With this project  I tried to plugin SwiftUIâ€™s declarative style TCA structure. I started to learn state management, actions, reducers and manage navigation via sheets. 

I also hard learned the importance of delivering a clean, well-organized technical test.

## Additional Work Since Friday

1. **Refactored Dependencies**: Fully modularized the app, organizing dependencies cleanly across modules.

2. **Mini Player**: Added a mini player to the station list screen, bringing playback controls directly to this screen.

3. **Improved Code Structure**: Enhanced code organization and more effectively applied TCA principles across the app.

4. **Animations**: Added a pulse animation around the play/pause button to visually reflect the audio playback.

5. **Minor UI Adjustments**: Tweaked colors, padding, and font sizes in the list and detail views to improve visual hierarchy and overall aesthetics.

## Moving Forward

1. **Dynamic Island Support**: Extend audio playback controls to the Dynamic Island for a better user experience.
2. **Advanced Animations**: Improve animations by exploring `matchedGeometryEffect` more thoroughly.
3. **Enhanced Design**: Experiment more with SwiftUI design to improve the visual layout, especially around audio player indicators and station cards.
4. **Localisation**: Utilize `.xcstrings` files for type-safe localization management.

## Time Spent

- **Day 1 (4 hours)**: Familiarized myself with TCA, initial API setup, and basic UI.
- **Day 2 (3 hours)**: Experimented with animations, encountering some issues with `matchedGeometryEffect`.
- **Day 3 (3 hours)**: Integrated the audio player feature and get back to bottom-sheet navigation.
- **Day 4 (2 hours)**: Implemented tests and worked on readme.
- **Day 5 (5 hours)**: Modularized Networking, AudioPlayer, Core, View and ViewDetails features
- **Day 6 (3 hours)**: Add the Miniplayer and button animations. Clean SwiftUI code. 
- **Day 7 (1,5 hours)**: Worked on readme and cleaned the last bit of code.
